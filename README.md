# Open in Provenance Safari Extension

This Safari extension on iOS 15 and higher works to make it easier to download ROM links in Provenance by automatically opening them in Provenance when the extension is enabled.

Everything occurs local, on-device. By open sourcing the extension I hope to make it clear what the extension is doing for anyone curious.
